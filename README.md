TECH STACK
Frontend
React.js: Utilized for building the user interface, providing a responsive and interactive experience for users.
Redux: A state management library. This choice facilitated the centralization of data, ensuring a predictable data flow and simplified interactions. With Redux, I effectively handled complex data flows while upholding maintainable and structured code practices.
TypeScript: Adds type safety to the JavaScript code, reducing bugs and improving maintainability.
Tailwind CSS: For consistent and efficient styling. This utility-first framework expedited the styling process with pre-built classes that seamlessly integrated into our HTML components. Tailwind's modular approach allowed for effortless customization, empowering me to maintain a cohesive design across the application..
Backend
Node.js: Provides a scalable runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build the API and handle HTTP requests and responses.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used to store user data, market information, and forum posts, providing flexibility and scalability.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB, used to define schemas and interact with the database.
Multer: Middleware for handling file uploads, used to process images uploaded for disease identification.
Cloudinary: A cloud-based image and video management service used for storing and processing uploaded images.
AI and Machine Learning
